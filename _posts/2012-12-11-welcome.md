Our goal as a company is to create a data-driven product that is powerful but simple.  This simplicity is for the benefit of usability, but it happens to hide a lot of things that we have behind the scenes, including masses of data, trained algorithms, and useful bits of code.

Some of these things we can share and some we can't, and our aim with this blog is to share what we can.  This will also be a channel for us to give a bit back to the same open source community that makes our lives easier.

Part of our aim here is purely self-interested: to attract talented engineers.  If you're a developer or data scientist with an interest in what we do, please email jobs@quantifind.com.  We look forward to hearing from you.
